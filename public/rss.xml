                <_cdata>&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;My friend gripped the steering wheel tighter as we crested another Wyoming hill on I-80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So you really believe we’ll all come back from the dead?” he asked, his voice carrying that particular mix of skepticism and hope that I’ve heard in so many conversations about faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside, the ancient landscape rolled past, layers of rock that had died and been reborn countless times through geological ages, each stratum telling its own story of creation and destruction. I thought of my aunt’s hands, how I could still see them perfectly in my mind, the way they moved the knitting needles with unconscious precision, creating something from nothing with every stitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think,” I said slowly, watching a hawk circle above the sagebrush, “there will come a day when it’s harder to stay dead than alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He laughed—not mockingly, but with genuine surprise. “That’s quite a claim.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was. But as we drove through that vast Wyoming emptiness, I found myself telling him about all
the ways we’re already becoming forensic scientists of the sacred, gathering evidence of souls we
thought were lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;decorative-spacer&quot;&gt;✦ ✦ ✦&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;“For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.&amp;quot; (Luke 12:2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scripture used to haunt me. As a child, I understood it as a warning: angels were watching our every deed, and God would eventually expose all our shameful secrets. But lately, I’ve begun to see it as a promise of restoration. Nothing lost forever. Everything recoverable. Even the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “atonement” helps me think about this differently. William Tyndale coined it to mean the state of being “at one,” unified, reconciled, made whole. We talk about Christ’s atonement as if it’s over and done, but look around. We’re not at one with each other, let alone with God. Tribalism and enmity still prevail. Death still separates families. Entropy still wins. The work isn’t finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s why Joseph Smith’s words lodge in my chest: “You have got to learn how to be gods yourselves… by going from one small degree to another… until you attain to the resurrection of the dead.”[^1] Not until you receive it. Until you attain it. As if resurrection is something we learn to do, not just something done to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brigham Young took this even further, teaching that we’d be responsible for resurrecting our deceased loved ones.[^2] As a young man, this astounded me. How could I, who couldn’t even keep the fish in my aquarium alive, raise the dead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, saving my mother’s emails, digitizing my dad’s letters sent to me on my mission, carefully preserving the pattern of my daughter’s laugh—I begin to see what he might have meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;decorative-spacer&quot;&gt;✦ ✦ ✦&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;I told my friend about Don Bradley first, a historian who refused to accept that some things could never be known. A mentor of Don’s had dismissed his question about which Bible edition young Joseph Smith had been reading as unanswerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some things,” the mentor said with professorial finality, “we can never know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Don had other ideas. Through the kind of obsessive, elegant sleuthing that makes historians simultaneously admirable and insufferable dinner guests, he discovered that each edition of the King James had its own pattern of grammatical errors, tiny flaws that Joseph unconsciously perpetuated when dictating the Isaiah chapters in the Book of Mormon. A few microscopic mistakes, preserved like a fingerprint across time, could reveal exactly which edition had sparked the Restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So this historian,” my friend said, navigating around a semi-truck, “he can figure out which Bible Joseph Smith read based on a grammar mistake?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Exactly. Information we thought was lost forever, recovered through persistence and careful attention to detail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wyoming landscape blurred past. I pointed to the exposed rock faces carved by ancient rivers. “A good geologist could run that whole process backward,” I said. “Take measurements of these formations, factor in erosion rates, wind patterns, water flow—then rewind time. Show you exactly how these hills were born.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sure,” he said, “but rocks aren’t people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when I told him about the pianos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;decorative-spacer&quot;&gt;✦ ✦ ✦&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;Have you ever listened to a scratchy old recording and wished you could hear it clearly? A few years ago, a company called Zenph Studios did something I still find miraculous. They taught computers to listen through the static and surface noise of century-old piano recordings and detect exactly which keys were pressed, how hard, how fast, even which pedals were used. The algorithms could peer through the fog of primitive recording technology and recover the precise physical movements of long-dead hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they fed this data to modern grand pianos equipped with high-resolution player systems. The result? Sergei Rachmaninoff, dead since 1943, playing again with crystalline clarity. Art Tatum’s impossible runs, cleaned of dust and static. Glenn Gould’s eccentricities, preserved and purified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a personal connection to this work, having originally suggested to the CEO of Zenph that they consider doing their magic on Tatum’s old recordings. The first time I heard one of these “re-performances,” sitting at my desk with tears running down my face, I thought: This is resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not metaphorical. Literal. The dead made to sing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even held concerts. Imagine walking into Carnegie Hall to hear George Gershwin—the actual patterns of his neurons and muscles, preserved in sound—playing “Rhapsody in Blue” with a living orchestra. His hands gone to dust, but their movement immortal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s beautiful,” my friend said quietly, “But we’re not pianos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” I agreed. “We’re much better documented.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;decorative-spacer&quot;&gt;✦ ✦ ✦&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;Every time you upload a photo, send a text, or even walk past a security camera, you create what forensic scientists call “trace evidence.” Your gait is as unique as your fingerprint. The way you construct sentences, the pauses in your speech, your facial expressions—all of it forms a constellation of data that is unmistakably you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought of my aunt again, not just her hands knitting, but that sparkle in her eye when she was about to deliver a particular wisecrack, the way her wit could slice through pretension like a hot knife through butter. She’d look at you over her glasses, pause just long enough to let you know something was coming, then deliver a line that would have the whole room laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have pictures now. Audio recordings. Her DNA lives on in her son and grandchildren, a genetic echo that could be sequenced and studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a recent conference in Berkeley, I learned that genomic prediction has advanced to the point where scientists can show expecting parents remarkably accurate previews of their unborn children: not just eye color, but facial structure, height, even disposition. If we can predict forward from DNA, why not backward? Why not rebuild?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same principles that let Don Bradley identify Joseph’s Bible, that let Zenph resurrect
Rachmaninoff, that let geologists rewind mountains—they all point to the same truth: Information
persists. Patterns leave traces. The universe remembers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;decorative-spacer&quot;&gt;✦ ✦ ✦&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;“But memory isn’t just data,” my friend pressed, and he was right to persist. “What makes you you isn’t just your DNA or even your behaviors. It’s your experiences, your relationships, your choices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I admit the edge of my faith meets the edge of my knowledge. We’re in the earliest days of understanding consciousness, just beginning to map the connectome, the impossibly complex wiring of the brain. But I think about Joseph Smith’s teaching that “there is no fundamental principle belonging to a human system that ever goes into another.”[^3] The pattern that is you remains yours, even as the materials cycle through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the Ship of Theseus paradox made personal: If every atom in your body is replaced over time, what makes you continuous? Early Mormon pioneers worried about this: What would happen to those whose bodies became part of the prairie grass, eaten by buffalo, scattered to the winds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph’s answer was that identity persists like a house remains the same house even as we replace its boards and nails. The pattern matters more than the particles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some will object that this reduces humans to mere information patterns, that it ignores the soul.
But our theology has always insisted that spirit is refined matter, that there’s no ultimate
distinction between physical and spiritual. The pattern that is you—what we might call your
intelligence or spirit—is as real as your body. More real, in fact, since it persists while your
physical materials constantly change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;decorative-spacer&quot;&gt;✦ ✦ ✦&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;As we drove through the descending darkness, stars beginning to pierce the Wyoming sky, I shared my wildest hopes. Theoretical physicists now propose that information might be preserved in ways we’re just beginning to glimpse, encoded holographically on the boundaries of space-time, tucked into dimensions beyond the three we can now perceive, preserved in the quantum foam that underlies reality itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You realize how this sounds,” my friend said, not unkindly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Like science fiction. I know.” I watched the stars, light from dead suns still reaching us, information preserved across impossible distances. “But so did airplanes. So did cell phones. So did healing the sick with mold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn’t say, but feel deeply, was how this knowledge changes the weight of grief. My aunt’s death still hurts, but differently now. Less like an ending, more like a puzzle I’m still gathering pieces for. Every photo I digitize, every story I record from siblings who remember her zingers, every knitting pattern she left behind—it’s all forensic evidence for a resurrection I’m learning to participate in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I mean by celestial forensics: We’re becoming detectives of the divine, crime scene investigators working the coldest cases in history. The “crime” is death itself, and we’re gradually assembling the evidence to overturn every conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Latter-day Saint tradition has always been about this work. We gather names, dates, stories: identify anchors for ordinance work. But I sense we’re on the cusp of something larger. The same urge that sends us to dusty archives and cemetery records might someday send us to quantum computers and DNA synthesizers. The spirit of Elijah evolves with our tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When genealogy websites can show you the face of your great-great-grandmother constructed from
genetic echoes in your own cells, when AI can extrapolate personality from personal writings, when
we can reverse-engineer the neural patterns that create a particular laugh or way of walking—we’re
not just remembering the dead. We’re reassembling them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;decorative-spacer&quot;&gt;✦ ✦ ✦&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;“I want to believe that,” my friend said as we pulled into a charging station, the Tesla’s battery nearly depleted. “But doesn’t it make God unnecessary? If we can resurrect ourselves?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plugged in the charging cable while considering this, watching other travelers, all of us between destinations, between who we were and who we’re becoming. The quiet hum of electricity flowing into the battery seemed like its own kind of resurrection, dead cells coming back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think,” I said finally, “it makes us necessary to God. Joseph Smith said we can’t be perfect without our dead, and they can’t be perfect without us. Maybe this is how: we become apprentice resurrectors, learning the family business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universe groans with information, every quantum state recorded, every moment fossilized in light
speeding between stars. Sacred ground turns out to be all ground, holy precisely because it holds
these traces. We’re not replacing God; we’re learning to see what God sees: that nothing is ever
truly lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;decorative-spacer&quot;&gt;✦ ✦ ✦&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;Back on the highway, my friend was quiet for a long time. The stars wheeled imperceptibly overhead, and I thought about all the light already in transit: messages from the past still arriving, still revealing. Somewhere in those photons was information about everyone who ever lived, if we only knew how to decode it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your aunt,” he said eventually. “The one who knitted. You really think you’ll see her again?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought of her teaching me to identify different yarns by touch, the way she’d guide my fingers across the fibers. “Feel that?” she’d say, that sparkle already in her eye. “That’s cheap acrylic pretending to be wool. Don’t let anyone fool you.” Even her teaching carried her wit. The memory was so clear I could see her shake her head at my clumsy attempts to learn the craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m seeing her right now,” I said. “But yes, I think someday I’ll hear her laugh again. And she’ll probably have a few things to say about how long it took us to bring her back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove on through the darkness, two friends carrying our dead with us, learning slowly how to call them back. The work of atonement continues. We practice resurrection daily in small ways: in preserved videos and recovered histories, in genetic echoes and quantum traces, in the stubborn insistence that love is stronger than entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that’s what Jesus meant when he prayed for God’s will to be done on earth as it is in heaven. Not that earth should cease to be earth, but that it should become the workshop where we learn heaven’s highest art: the defeat of death itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road stretched on before us, an asphalt ribbon through time. Every mile marker passed was a small victory over distance, every moment another fragment of eternity we were learning to decode. Somewhere behind us, our ancestors waited. Somewhere ahead, the morning was already breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will come a day when it’s harder to stay dead than alive. We’re already working on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                <_cdata>&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;The death of Jesus left his followers devastated. As their promised messiah, they assumed he would deliver Israel from its oppressors in triumph and military might. Imagine their heartbreak when instead they witnessed his humiliating defeat as a common criminal on a Roman cross. From that moment on, every disciple was faced with difficult questions: Was all of this in vain? Was Jesus a failure, or was there some deeper purpose in his apparent defeat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among historians there is widespread agreement that the Judeo-Christian concept of a suffering servant, or of a savior who could somehow win by being defeated, was a unique theological innovation that had not been strongly articulated previously in human history. And this concept was destined to go viral in a benighted world that before could only conceive of victory as dominating one’s enemies. Viewed in this new light, the more the Christians were persecuted, the more they seemed victorious, and the stronger they became.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suffering and death of Jesus has come to be called the atonement in the Christian world. Atonement is a word that was coined by the famous bible translator and Protestant martyr William Tyndale. It is the conjunction of two words, “at one,” with the noun ending -ment. Tyndale was searching for a singular description of this strange act of Jesus whose objective was to reunite humanity with God, to bring each of us, and every person who has ever lived and who will ever live to a state of being “at one” with God, with Christ, and with each other. During his suffering in the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus prayed that we might “all be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us” (John 17:21).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Tyndale, we are indebted to several prior Christian thinkers who’ve tried to understand this mystery. We sometimes assume that the Restoration wiped the slate clean, but we still owe a great debt to theologians who have gone before us. From that moment of bitter disappointment on Golgotha, Christians have been trying to make sense of the atonement, to explain how it works, so that it can truly have power in their lives and ultimately be brought to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem strange to speak of the atonement as something that hasn’t yet been brought to pass, but
Tyndale’s word itself helps us see why it might make sense to speak of it this way. It is painfully
obvious that we aren’t yet fully “at one” with God or with humanity, as we witness the cruelty and
enmity that so many harbor towards their neighbor, both in our personal lives, in our national
discourse, and in foreign affairs. So this word “atonement” reminds us that there is still more work
to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;decorative-spacer&quot;&gt;✦ ✦ ✦&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;There are three main ways of thinking about the atonement that have shaped our views on the topic over the years, and that I’d like to explain briefly today. Each of these ways of thinking was articulated to some degree by early Christian church leaders, but some of them took several centuries to be fully developed. Each of them also has scriptural support, including the support of restoration scriptures like the Book of Mormon. Each of them also makes vital contributions to our understanding of the atonement. For handy reference, I’ll use a single word to refer to each of them: ransom, substitution, and influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest theories that was first taught by early Christian leaders like Irenaeus and Origen in the second century was the ransom theory, which taught that Christ freed mankind from Satan’s control, allowing us to overcome sin and death. This theory claimed that the devil had exceeded his authority by torturing the sinless man Jesus, thus forfeiting his right to hold humanity hostage for its sinfulness. This may also sound familiar to those who’ve read the Chronicles of Narnia. In his allegory about a witch whose magic was undone when she couldn’t resist the opportunity to torture the blameless king Aslan, C. S. Lewis revived this ancient theory. In the Book of Mormon, we hear a similar concept from Jacob, who rejoices, “O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel! For he delivereth his saints from that awful monster the devil, and death, and hell, and that lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment” (2 Ne. 9:19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it explained some things, the ransom theory still left people with many questions. In the 11th century, a man named Anselm of Canterbury shared what he called the satisfaction theory, and which later came to be called the substitution theory of atonement. This theory explained that through sin, humanity had become indebted and could no longer dwell in God’s presence, and that cosmic justice demanded that this debt must be repaid. It taught further that through his suffering, Christ paid this debt, thus allowing humanity to return to God’s presence by complying with Christ’s conditions. Alma taught a similar concept to his son Corianton: “And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence. And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also.” (Alma 42:14-15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding is probably the most common way of describing the atonement today among both
Christians in general and Latter-day Saints, but it still has some important limitations. By
emphasizing human sinfulness and the possibility of forgiveness, the substitution theory tends to
cause Christians to focus primarily on what they should do as individuals to get right with God and
make the atonement efficacious in their personal lives, but too often this focus never goes beyond
the individual’s relationship with God, neglecting our relationship with each other, seeming to
entirely forget that we must eventually be at one not only with God, but also with our neighbor.
Substitution often focuses on the reparation of damages, but not on the heaven that we should build
in their place. How we think about the atonement influences our attitude towards God and our
behavior towards our fellow human beings. In the words of American founder and skeptic Thomas Paine,
“Belief in a cruel god makes a cruel man.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;decorative-spacer&quot;&gt;✦ ✦ ✦&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;In response to Anselm’s theory, a French theologian named Peter Abelard proposed what came to be called the moral influence theory of atonement. He felt like the idea of Jesus’s death as a ransom paid to the devil gave too much deference to Satan, and he also disliked the emphasis on God’s judgment. Rather than changing God’s view of humanity, Abelard thought that the purpose of the atonement was to change humanity’s view of God, from an offended, harsh and judgemental being to one of perfect love and compassion. According to Abelard, Jesus died to demonstrate God’s love, and this awareness can change the hearts and minds of sinners, inspiring them to become reconciled with God and with one another. Jesus is thus the example we should follow, not just the one who pays for our sins. His life influences all humanity through his brilliant example. For this reason, I’ve used the keyword influence to remind us of this third way of looking at the atonement. We are called to take the name of Christ upon us and imitate him, not just by doing good in the world, but also in his willingness to go beyond the ordinary expectations of human decency, to be a peacemaker and to take responsibility for sin and death even though he wasn’t the cause of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Book of Mormon, Nephi exhorts us to follow Christ’s example: “And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?” (2 Nephi 31:10) We also hear the resurrected Christ explaining his role as exemplar: “my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me.” (3 Ne. 27:15) Throughout his life, Jesus gave us a bright and shining example of how we should treat our neighbor, inviting us to “go and do … likewise.” (Luke 10:37) As I read the scriptures, I get the feeling that Jesus really means it when he invites us to follow him, and truly believes in our capacity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the atonement doesn’t just consist in Jesus’s suffering, but also his entire life. Even his very
coming into the world is a singular example of God’s love for humanity. “For God so loved the world,
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world
through him might be saved.” (John 3:16-17)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;decorative-spacer&quot;&gt;✦ ✦ ✦&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;two-column&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;Balancing these views of atonement can help us to be reconciled not only with God but also with each other; it can help us focus not just on a zero-sum conception of repaid debts but on a vision of abundant flourishing in a harmonious Zion-like community; it can help us remember that the atonement isn’t complete until we are at one. As we understand the atonement more fully, we realize that it is not just an event, but a process, and that the work can never be complete if only Jesus does his part, as important as that part may be. As members of the body of Christ who have taken his name upon ourselves, we must join Jesus and together do the work of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying this deeper understanding to the second coming of Christ, we realize that if the individual Jesus returns to earth without a body of saints in Christ prepared to meet him, the second coming hasn’t fully taken place. Jesus, as head of the body of Christ, may have returned, but the rest of the body has not. Joseph Smith prophesied that the hearts of the human family must turn towards each other or “the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming” (D&amp;amp;C 2:3). The atonement hasn’t fully come to pass until we are at one, and Christ hasn’t fully returned until the body of Christ can be found upon the earth in its fullness, with all its members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can sometimes seem like a daunting prospect. The poet Rainer Maria Rilke may have described
this feeling when he said, “What we choose to fight is so tiny! What fights with us is so great.”
But I find comfort in Christ’s invitation to follow him, and in his willingness to share in the
struggle with us. In our own small way, in our own lives, in our own family, in our own community,
in our own ward, stake, and Church, and then in an ever growing circle, we can build Zion and
prepare the world for the second coming of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</_cdata>
